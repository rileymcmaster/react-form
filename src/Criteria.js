// Front-end Developer

// Scenario to implement: Create a newsletter subscription screen using ReactJS.

// No UI framework are allowed in this project. Candidate can style the component as they like as long as itâ€™s not using a UI framework.
// (Riley here: I asked and they said that styled-components was ok)

// Simply create a ReactJS project and implement the requested scenario.

// 3 input text fields:
// Name
// Company
// Email

// 1 checkbox to agree to subscribe to newsletter.

// 2 buttons:
// 1 to submit
// 1 to clear/reset the form

// The submit button needs to validate that the 3 input fields are filled and that the email is a valid email address, and that the checkbox is checked.

// If any field is invalid, notify the user that the field is invalid and what the issue is.

// If all fields are valid, change screen and show the user that they have successfully subscribed to the newsletter.

// The reset form button clears the form (all inputs and errors), and the form should still work as intended.

// Make the 3 input text fields a reusable component.

// Make the 2 button a reusable component.
